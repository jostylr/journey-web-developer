# Text

We will start with getting content out there. While it is important to learn all the various technologies, it is also important to start generating content. Work through what you have in mind.

We start with Word and Google Docs. This gets information out there. We will also explore a bit of spreadsheets and Google forms. Sometimes, these are all you need.

Next, we will dive into Markdown. We first discuss what it is and do a test drive.

With Markdown as our driver, we will explore various tools such as Git, GitHub, Pandoc, and text editors. We do give a few words about hosting your Markdown docs on GitHub.

This concludes basic text creation.
